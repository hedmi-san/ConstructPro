## 🏗️ Overview

## 🧱 System Architecture

The project follows a clean, modular **MVC-like architecture**:

```
constructpro/
│
├── DAO/             → Data Access Objects (SQL operations)
│
├── DTO/             → Data Transfer Objects (data models)
│
├── Service/         → Application logic and UI dialogs
│
└── resources/       → Icons, themes, configuration (optional)
```

Each layer has a **single responsibility**:

- **DTO**: Represents database entities as Java objects.
- **DAO**: Encapsulates all SQL operations (insert, update, fetch).
- **Service/UI**: Provides the user interface and orchestrates DAO logic.
